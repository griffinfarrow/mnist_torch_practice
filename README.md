# mnist_torch_practice
  
This is a notebook for getting to learn Pytorch by building a play CNN and using it on the MNIST dataset  

## Steps of the process 

1) Load dataset and labels 
2) Either use a standard dataset or write a custom dataset class 
3) Define dataloaders
4) Build model and specify how you can build the forward pass
5) Define training and evaluation loops
